        - use JSON to parse from wikipedia
        - connect that with wikipediaarticle & wikipediaAPI
        - User will pull data from wikiart & wikiAPI
          to give the "user" the info they want
        - ErrorHandling will keep the errors from breaking
          my laptop
        - Updates will pull data from wikiart & wikiAPI
          and hold onto that data?? (up for interpretation)
        - print list of changes; pull data from Updates
