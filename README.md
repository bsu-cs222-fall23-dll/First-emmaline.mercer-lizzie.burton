    PROJECT SUMMARY: 

        This project responds to the user story
    provided in the specs document by allowing
    the user to enter an article title and receive
    the 13 most recent changes, in reverse-chronological
    order, as well as the timestamps and the users who 
    made the changes.
        If the user enters a blank line, the code will 
    return an error telling the user they didn't put in any
    input. If their is a network error, the user will be able
    to see an error telling them about that network error.
        

    BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

        In order to run this application, the user must at least
    have Java 17 and the IntelliJ software. The Community edition
    will work just fine for this project. The user must go into the 
    bsu-cs222-fall23-dll organization, in GitHub, and find the 
    repository named "First-emmaline.mercer-lizzie.burton".
        The repository must be cloned by copying the repository's link
    provided in GitHub. After opening up IntelliJ, the user must click 
    on Get from VCS in IntelliJ and then paste the copied GitHub url into
    the url space provided. It is up to the user which directory the choose
    to save the code in. Then, the user will hit the clone button.
        After all of the steps above are achieved, the user will now have 
    the IntelliJ project open. They must click on 
    src/main/java/edu.bsu.cs22/CLIManager. In the top right corner, there 
    is a green arrow. The user must push that to run the application. The
    command prompt will appear on the bottom of the screen and ask the user
    for an article title. The user must provide an article title. Then, the 
    project runs and provides the user with 13 most recent changes, timestamps,
    and users. The code has now been succesfully run.
